If Default is selected, a worker machine will be randomly selected for execution.</li>\n<li>Environment Name: Configure the environment name in which to run the script.</li>\n<li>Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task exceeds the &quot;timeout period&quot;, an alarm email will be sent and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li>Sub-node: It is the workflow definition of the selected sub-process. Enter the sub-node in the upper right corner to jump to the workflow definition of the selected sub-process.</li>\n<li>Predecessor task: Selecting a predecessor task for the current task will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Example</h2>\n<p>This example simulates a common task type, here we use a child node task to recall the <a href=\"shell.md\">Shell</a> to print out &quot;hello world&quot;. This means that a shell task is executed as a child node.</p>\n<h3>Create Shell task</h3>\n<p>Create a shell task to print &quot;hello&quot;. And define the workflow for this as test_dag01.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task01.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task01\"></p>\n<h2>Create Sub_process task</h2>\n<p>To use the sub_process, you need to create the  sub-node task, which is the shell task we created in the first step. Then, as shown in the diagram below, select the corresponding sub-node in the â‘¤ position.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task02.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task02\"></p>\n<p>After creating the sub_process is complete, create a corresponding shell task for printing &quot;world&quot; and link the two together.Save the current workflow and run it to get the desired result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task03.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task03\"></p>\n<h2>Notice</h2>\n<p>When using sub_process to recall a sub-node task, you need to ensure that the defined sub-node is online, otherwise the sub_process workflow will not work properly.</p>\n",
